# CHISEL Code Snippets. 

A repository where I collate my Hardware modules.  
Since it is used for educational purposes, it also includes
working, modern and modified code from the outdated [Chisel Bootcamp](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-bootcamp).

---
For the sake of documenting the learning steps, here is what I 
learned in each module.

## PassThrough
* Straightforward component that merely reflects its input.
* Creating parameterized Chisel Generators.
* Running unit tests.
* Introduction to Chisel datatypes and SystemVerilog elaboration.
